Angular Basics:
================

I enrolled in "Angular - The Complete Guide (2023 Edition)" by maximilian and decided to make this repo to provide all my notes and projects during this course. Also to stay motivated and focused, while still having fun

### I was motivated and inspired by Thi's blog
```javascript
app.controller('showPostCtrl', function($scope){
  $scope.text = "example:\n line 1\n line 2\n line 3\n [http://example.com](https://dinhanhthi.com/angular-1-basics-components-databinding-directives/)"
});
```
