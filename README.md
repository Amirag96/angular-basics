Angular Basics:
================

I enrolled in "Angular - The Complete Guide (2023 Edition)" by maximilian and decided to make this repo to provide all my notes and projects during this course. Also to stay motivated and focused, while still having fun

[I was motivated and inspired by Thi's blog](https://dinhanhthi.com/angular-1-basics-components-databinding-directives/) :sparkles:

## What is Angular?
• Angular is a javascript framework which allows you to create reactive single page applications (SPA)
• It gives the user a very reactive experience
• Javascript changes the DOM element in the runtime
